          The purpose of solar panels is that they collect clean, renewable energy in the form of sunlight. The collected sunlight will be transformed into electricity. Solar panels are made from a different number of parts. The most important of which are silicon cells. Silicon cells are the most important because when the sunlight interacts with a silicon cell, the electrons inside the cell will be set into motion. The official name for this progress is called the photovoltaic effect. Because of this motion it is possible to make electricity from the sunlight.

            Charge controller

        <p>
          A charge controller is really important to have. If you only have solar panels you would not be able to gain usable electricity. Most of the people will say that the next step after the solar panels will be a battery which will save the electricity. But a really important object between the solar panel and the battery is the charge controller. The charge controller manages the power from the solar panel. It ensures that the batteries are not overcharged, and that the batteries arenâ€™t drained when there is no sunlight.

        <p>
          A battery is very important to have if you want so use the collected energy as efficient as possible. Because if you do not have any batteries. You can only use the solar energy when there is sunlight available. And if you do not use electricity when there is sunlight you would waste that energy. With batteries you can collect the gained electricity and save it for when there is no sunlight available. In this way you will benefit the most from your solar panels.

            DC power
          </h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          We are already seeing the end of a solar energy system but there are still a few important steps to make. One important thing is that solar panels itself produces DC power. DC power stands for Direct Current power. This probably will not say you much. But the real problem is that household devices are not able to use this kind of power, they use AC power. But, of course, there is a solution to this problem. The solution of this problem is called an inverter. In the next paragraph you will read more about this.

            Inverter

        </header>
        <p>
          As stated before, an inverter is a solution to the DC power problem. This makes an inverter also a really important piece of a solar energy system. Without an inverter the electricity made is useless because household devices use AC power. And you probably already guessed it, but indeed, an inverter converts DC power into AC power. It is really important to have a good quality inverter, because than there will be a minimal energy loss during the transformation.

            AC power
          </h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          This is the last step of a solar energy system. As stated before, AC power is the kind of energy that is useable by household devices. AC power is short for Alternating Current power. After all the previous steps you finally have electricity that you can use. Clean, renewable energy that will not affect the climate and in the end, also will not affect your money. I only see benefits when it comes to solar energy.
